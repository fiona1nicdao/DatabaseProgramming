_databse schema_ the description of a database 
    specified during database design 
    no expected to change often 
_schema diagram_ a display schema 
    the diagram displays the structure of each record type but not the actual instance of records
_schema construct_ each object in the schema 
_database state or snapshot_ the data in database at a particular moment in time 
    the current set of _occurrences_ or _instances_ in the database
    in a given database state, each schema construct has its own current set of instance
_define_ a new database , we specify its database schema only to the DBMS
empty state = no data
intial state of the database when the database is first _populated_ or _loaded_ with the intital data
the DBMS is partly responsible for ensuring that every state of the database is a _valid state_ 
_valid state_ a state that satisfies the structure and constraints specifed in the schema 
the DBMS stores the descriptions of hte schema constructs and constraints also called the meta-data in the DBMS catalog so that DBMS software can refer to the schema whenever it needs to
the schema is also called _intension_ 
a database state is called _extention_ of the schema 
_schema evoluation_ when the schema changes when the database is operational
